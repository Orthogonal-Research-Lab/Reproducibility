## How to make content contributions:  

1) use [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) to annotate web-based content.

* make notes on the website pages themselves or make notes about how to utilize content for a specific workshop idea.

* these notes remain public and collaborative in the hypothes.is browser extension.
  
  
2) create a web note (using tools such as a [Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/web%20notes?hl=en) or [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027048/microsoft-edge-add-notes-to-sites)). Please adhere to the following steps:   

* make your markups using your chosen app.

* when finished, save as an image file (.jpg format).  

* upload and push the image to the [Web Notes](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/reproducibility-4-everybody/tree/master/making-content-contributions/web-notes) repository.


3) submit a poster, workshop curriculum, or topical presentation.

* please join our [Slack community](http://reproducibilityws.slack.com) or make a pull request in the [New Content](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/reproducibility-4-everybody/tree/master/making-content-contributions/new-content) repository to submit your contribution.
