## Plan for working days, R4E group:  

1) Make clear what the working day is about. It is best practice to have a plan for what you would like to accomplish prior to the working day. Working days are meant to facilitate small group interactions and meaningful feedback. This is best achieved if all are invested in the common goal. Not everyone in the group needs to be present, yet everyone who wants should be able to contribute.  


2) schedule a "best fit" 24h period. This is meant to accomodate people across many timezones, so if you want to work with specific people, plan accordingly.  


3) send out an availability schedule where people provide their most "tuned in" times.  

4) business can be conducted in the Slack team [reproducibilityws.slack.com](http://reproducibilityws.slack.com)  

5) we will provide an availability schedule (see #2) and a Zoom meeting space to conduct business.  

6) although working days are meant to be of general interest, we expect specialty groups to be particularly active during this time. Those groups are:  

* Group organization  

* Material Development  

* Outreach and Communication  

* Workshops and Training
